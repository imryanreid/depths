 * `www`, matching the rest of the family — the family picked one and the only
 * thing that matters is that every tool picks the same one, since a site
 * reachable at both spellings splits its own crawl.
 *
 * Override per-environment with `VITE_SITE_URL` (set it in the Vercel project
 * settings if you ever want preview deploys to generate self-referencing
 * links). Falls back to production so a plain `pnpm build` is always correct.
