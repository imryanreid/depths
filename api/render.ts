// ==============================================
// GET /
//
// The site is a client-rendered SPA, so a plain fetch
// of a share link returns an empty <div id="root">—
// nothing an agent could read unless it executes
// JavaScript, which most link-following agents don't.
//
// This serves the same index.html with the shadow
// scale injected, so one URL works for people and for
// agents. The React app still boots and takes over;
// the injected block sits outside #root so hydration
// never touches it, and main.tsx removes it on mount.
//
// The bare homepage comes through here too, carrying
// the default scale—it's the URL an agent lands on
// when it was told the tool's name but given no link.
// Only *parameterized* URLs get their <head>
// rewritten; the homepage keeps the metadata that
// makes it the site's one indexable page.
//
// Ported from Ramps' api/render.ts (via Beeps), which
// learned most of the constraints below in production.
// Read the comments before simplifying any of them.
