// agents and scripts that want data rather than a

//
// Same query contract as the site itself, so an
// agent handed a share link can swap "/" for
// "/api/shadows" and get the machine-readable form.
// Pure function of the query string—no state, no
// storage—so responses cache indefinitely.
//
// The payload itself lives in src/lib/agent.ts and
// is shared with /api/render. One serialization, per
// the family rule—an endpoint that drifts from the
// page is how this tool would end up lying to
// somebody.
